1. **First pass**: Get a general overview and sense of what's in the course and where you need to brush up on.
   1. Go slow.
   2. No notes.
   3. Do the exercises.
   4. Follow along with the code.
   5. Take the quiz.
   6. Repeat for every single lesson in course.

2. Second pass: Concise notes to capture core concepts.

3. Third (or greater) Pass: Assessment prep mode and creating your own study guide.
   1. Go back to all lessons.
   2. Take notes on important concepts for the assessment.
   3. Review quizzes.
      1. Hide answers.
      2. Attempt to answer all (or almost all) questions correctly.
      3. If successful, you're ready to move on to next lesson.
   4. You're probably ready for the assessment now.

Study Guide:
- Copy the topics from study guide into new notes.
- Put examples under each of the topic headers/sub-headers.
- When done, put "DONE" next to header.
- Quick review.


Note-taking process:
1. Quick bullet point process of core concepts.
2. Summarize and recall key concepts on own words while providing examples for all of them. Explain what the code demonstrates, precisely.


Benefits of the FB approach:
- Minimize time being stuck on concepts
- Just come back to the material later on.
