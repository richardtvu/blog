title: Community and Enjoying the Journey

I wish to become a teaching assistant at Launch School because I've found I enjoy teaching and supporting my launch school friends in studying. I enjoy seeing my Pocahontas grow and become more confident in herself, in her persistence, in her ability to break down code~. I enjoy seeing my JD grow in patience, in communication ability, and in discipline. I enjoy being pleasantly surprised by how my friends ask questions that get me thinking and helping me learn from a different perspective.

The ideal outcome is slowing down to build community and to build long-lasting and loving friendships. In slowing down, I'd get to enjoy learning and teaching more, to rejoice in the meaning that comes from helping others, to savor my time at Launch School and my time at my job as a developer. Perhaps, I'll look back on this time in my life as bliss. Thankfully, this time is already bliss.

My main inner obstacles are fear and competency. I fear not knowing enough to teach others and not being experienced enough to structure teaching (or guidance) sessions that'll be effective and efficient in serving my fellow Launchies.

My plan is to do what I do with difficult programming problems: Decompose the problem into smaller chunks and scaffold my way up from the bottom until I solve the problem.

In fact, this blog post is part of my scaffolding. By setting forth my aim and the purpose of my aim, I set forth a vision of an ideal future to motivate me. By identifying my obstacle, I gain clarity on where I am at and can begin to identify the path to this heaven I see.

To gain competency in programming and teaching and experience, I will aim to become a Study, Teach, Overlearn, and Practice lead for RB109. To become a SPOT lead that'll be effective, I will want to thoroughly understand the fundamentals taught in RB100 and RB101, in addition to passing the written and oral assessments. To build these fundamentals, I will want to write blog articles that'll summarize my processs, my learnings, and concepts and then share these with my peers. By sharing these articles, I will help my peers, solidify my understanding, and gain the opportunity for feedback to strengthen my mental models.

In the process, I'll meet my need for connection, (hopefully) appreciation, and contribution. Meeting these needs will help me maintain my motivation and enjoy the journey. Let's go, starting with publishing my unrefined notes on the written assessment prep process/notes!
