Here's an unrefined collection of notes ...

# Preparing to lead first SPOT session for RB101/109

1. Get a list of written questions to give.
2. Get a list of interview questions to give.
3. Review your process (intros/disclaimers), questions, and cycling through written or interview questions.

## List of Written Questions

General structure for practicing the Written Assessment Questions:

1. What does the code output and return?
2. Why?
3. Which concept(s) does this problem illustrate? (e.g. local variable scope)

Misc. Tips

1. Use **backticks**, `` ` ``, to highlight code, such as variable names, methods, and expressions. No need to backtick line numbers.
2. Think of the study guide as a word bank of concepts. These are the only concepts relevant to question #3 (on the written exam).

    - e.g. A concept, for whatever reason, might demonstrate the importance of single responsibility for a class ... but that's outside of the scope of RB109. A concept can be demonstrated and true in a particular example without being relevant to how to answer the question.
