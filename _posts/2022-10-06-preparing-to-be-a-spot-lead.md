Here's an unrefined collection of notes ... from the SPOT wiki, leads, etc.

# Preparing to lead first SPOT session for RB101/109

1. Get a list of written questions to give.
2. Get a list of interview questions to give.
3. Review your process (intros/disclaimers), questions, and cycling through written or interview questions.

## Topics to review

- local variable scope in context of:
  - method invocation
  - method definition
  - blocks
- mutation vs non-mutation
- collections
- variable as pointers
- puts vs return
- truthiness - false vs nil
- method definition vs. method invocation
- implicit return values
- `Array#sort`

## Written Questions List Prep

General structure for practicing the Written Assessment Questions:

1. What does the code output and return?
2. Why?
3. Which concept(s) does this problem illustrate? (e.g. local variable scope)

### Misc. Tips

1. Use **backticks**, `` ` ``, to highlight code, such as variable names, methods, and expressions. No need to backtick line numbers.
2. Think of the study guide as a word bank of concepts. These are the only concepts relevant to question #3 (on the written exam).

    - e.g. A concept, for whatever reason, might demonstrate the importance of single responsibility for a class ... but that's outside of the scope of RB109. A concept can be demonstrated and true in a particular example without being relevant to how to answer the question.

- Steps:
  - Introductions
    - Where are we at in the curriculum?
    - Where are we currently located?
    - What do we need?

## Reminders for me ...
https://launchschool.com/community_guidelines
###  Keep your interactions professional

In general, you should aim to be polite and professional in your interactions.
Treat staff and other students as you would do colleagues in the workplace.
Please refrain from politics or religion and other topics that may be sensitive.
Have fun but keep in mind that Launch School serves students of all backgrounds from around the world.

### Keep programming discussions focused on Launch School

When discussing programming, please aim to keep these discussions Launch School focused, i.e. on topics that we cover in the curriculum, or tips on studying at launch School. For example:
- Avoid talking about other programs or boot-camps
- Discussing arbitrary programming topics or projects which are outside the scope of the Launch School curriculum.
