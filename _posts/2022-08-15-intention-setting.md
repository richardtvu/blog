# Written Assessment Preparations

**WISH**: Prepare for the written assessment by actively engaging with the study materials.

I will actively engage the Launch School (LS) materials by going through the study guide, the articles in the study guide, and then creating my own versions of the materials. I will use spaced repetitions, active recall, self-explanation, and teaching. These notes will serve as my drafting stage, with no judgment (yet) and with the end goal of creating a study guide that makes sense to me, is accurate, precise, and can be used to help my peers learning coding concepts.

**Audience**: Future Richard, who'll be months away from having practiced RB101 material; my fellow friends Amy, JD, Obi; newbies starting RB101/entering RB109.

> You are best positioned to help people one step behind you. The material is still fresh in your mind. Many experts have forgotten what it was like to be a beginner (or an intermediate) and have forgotten why the topic is hard to understand when you first hear it. The context of your particular background, your particular style, and your knowledge level will give a different twist to what youâ€™re writing about.

**OUTCOME**: This blog will help act as my second brain, whwere I can practice _learning in public_, which will eventually incentivize me to organize my notes in an easier-to-grok fashion. Mastery of the fundamentals and consistency in revisiting topics, allowing me to intergrate and deeply make the fundamentals a core part of my being.

Build a strong sense of community, meaning, altruism, generosity, and emotional intelligence, in addition to communication skills as I serve my LS brethren.This investmen will also help me lengthenand savor my time in a mastery-based learning (MBL) environment, thereby deepening my growth, discipline, meaning, and love. Also friends and intentionality.

**OBSTACLE**: My main inner obstacle will probably be a sense of impatience and boredom. Another is fear of making my journey public due to fear of criticism or something bad happening

**PLAN**: If I see any warning signs or just straight up feel impatient or bored, then I'll publish what I have ... and just start publishing regardless (e.g. this blog post).

If I feel fear, then I will set my intention on my blog homepage/readme, e.g. "This blog will contain unpolished thoughts I'm having as I'm learning. My posts will most likely have many grammar, spelling, and logic errors."
