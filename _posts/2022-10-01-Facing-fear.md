# Decision: Become a SPOT Lead

## Context

I had been feeling some confusion, worry, and amotivation about RB120 these last few days. Thoughts bubbled up:

> "If I don't keep up with my friends, then I won't have any value to them anymore. If I don't have any value, then I'll lose my friends. If I lose my friends, then I will be lonely. And being lonely would be too much.

Underlying these thoughts was a limiting belief: "My friends love me only for what I do for them, not for who I am."

Initially, this thought came up:

> Okay, then study harder. Move faster. If you keep up your progress, then you can keep helping your friends and keep their love.

But sorrow arose from the pit of my stomach into what felt like an empty aching hole at my sternum. I realized that I'd be setting myself up for misery and depression if I followed this path. I realized that I can't run away from this fear or let it control my life.

Instead, ...

> I shall face this fear. I will let this fear pass over me and through me.

I decided.

> I will _slow down_ and challenge my fear through vulnerability and faith that my friends _do_ love me for who I am (of which what I do is simply a portion of who I am).

By slowing down and allowing my friends to overtake me, I give my friends the opportunity to love me regardless of what I can do for them, to meet up with me, and to encourage each other even without my teaching them. By slowing down, I can show myself that even when people move on in their studies or in their career, we can still be friends and I can still be connected and loved.

## The Wish

What's more, I can continue helping people. I _wish_ to be a SPOT lead and facilitate/guide students in RB109 for the near future, while making small steps each day in my RB120 studies. Through serving others and slowing down, I will embody vulnerability, humbleness, surrender and thereby nuture and support love. By practicing empathy, meeting students where they are, doing some preparation for lessons, I will deeply ingrain the fundamentals of programming, develop leadership and teaching capabilities. I will have more peace and security, for I will have even more evidence that my friends do care and that I can love and be loved even without doing, just being.

The main inner fear I have of slowing down is fear of abandonment and fear of stagnation. To counter these fears, I will share my fears (and have shared with a friend) and enlist their help. I will make small steps in RB120, so that I'm learning a little everyday instead of stopping entirely.

## Some Ideas/Thoughts

- Striking the balance between positive and constructive feedback, biasing towards warmth and encouragement.
- Framing study sessions with an emphasis on mastery, as opposed to a grade.
- Experimenting with structures, hand-signals, boundaries/expectations.
- Actively informing others that I've much room to grow.
- Focusing on having fellow students participate, as opposed to lecturing.
