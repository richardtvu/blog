Recently, I talked to some friends about my experience with the assessments and the course in general. These conversations and my experience helped me affirm Launch School as absolutely worth the time and effort (for me) because:
1. I've developed _real_ confidence based on real accomplishments that I can grow as a developer and transform myself through giving back to others, learning from others, etc.
2. There are so many like-minded people who help encourage me and are encouraged by me to do what matters in life: To focus on what is meaningful, instead of taking shortcuts.
3. I get visceral, concrete feedback that I'm on the right path.
