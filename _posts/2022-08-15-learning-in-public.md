Dear Richard,

I'm proud of you for developing the discipline of studying programming everyday and for learning by teaching! You've realized that not only does teaching help you learn better, sharing what you've learned helps you fulfill your need for community, connection, and meaning. Now, it's time to take another step in improving your learning capacity by leanring in public.

I know. You've felt scared of sharing what you've learned in public:
- What if internet trolls come out to attack you?
- What if you say something wrong and your career ends?
- What if you come off as inauthentic and attention-seeking?
- What if... \[insert multitudes of catastrophic hypotheticals\]?

Well, you've seen that your friends have appreciated the hard work you've put into helping them. You've seen your mentor and coworkers at work appreciate how you put in time to document things and make sure you can communicate technical problems and solutions to them. You've also seen that even when you made mistakes, whether it was in social faux pas or in technical knowledge/communication, your friends and coworkers have forgiven you and accepted you.

Thus, I believe that as long as you continue to do your best to be respectful, humble, and accountable, that reasonable people will continue to accept and care about you. And that's what really matters: The people who matter to you will still accept you and appreciate you, even when you make a silly mistake (as long as you've done the mistake in good faith)!

With that being said, let's talk about learning in public and what you'll want to do with it:

- Write about what the things you struggled with:
  - What you did
  - The problems you solved.

- Keep your past self in mind as your audience. There's enough similarity between your past self and future you that at the very least, you'll help yourself out even if nobody else feels helped. And with enough tries, you'll eventually be able to help others out too!

So... Embrace the suck!
- Take your time.
- Build the habit of writing down your thoughts everyday (or several times a week).
- Acknowledge and let go of the temptation to seek success through blogging - this is about how you can help yourself and eventually others!
- Be humble. When you aren't sure, admit that you aren't certain.


Remember: [**You are not your writing.**]((https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/):
). The point of thinking and writing is to help you clarify what's important, learn, and help others. If someone finds problems with your writing, great! That person just helped you see a blind spot that you can correct and improve.


You've seen time and time again, when your friends can't understand what you're teaching, there's a good chance you have work to do on your understanding of what you're teaching. So if your writing doesn't make sense, so be it. You've just found a spot to revise and brush up on your models.


And now, you're just taking this process of learning by teaching to the next level. Congrats Richard!

Sincerely,

Richard
