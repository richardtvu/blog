> Whatever your thing is, make the thing you wish you had found
when you were learning. Document what you did and the problems you
solved. Organize what you know and then Open Source Your Knowl-
edge."
> Don’t judge your results by retweets or stars or upvotes — just talk to
yourself from three months ago. Resist the immediate bias for atten-
tion. Your process needs to survive regardless of attention, if it is to
survive at all. Eventually, they will come. But by far the biggest benefi-
ciary of you helping past you, will be future you. If (when) others benefit,
that’s icing on the cake.

brand, you also have no expectations weighing you down. You can ex-

periment with different formats, different domains. You can take your
time to get good. Build the habit. Build your platform. Get comfortable
with your writing/content creation process. Ignore the peer pressure
to become an “overnight success” — even “overnight successes” went

> 1.4 Teach to Learn
“If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well

Did I mention that teaching is the best way to Learn in Public? You only
truly know something when you’ve tried teaching it to others. All at

concepts, structure content for completeness, and answer questions you
never had.
Probably the most important skill in teaching is learning to talk while
you code. It can be stressful but you can practice it like any other skill.
It turns a mundane talk into a captivating high-wire act. It makes pair
programming a joy rather than a chore. My best technical interviews
have been where I ended up talking like I teach, instead of trying to

>  Cunningham’s Law: “The best way to get the right answer on the In-
ternet is not to ask a question; it’s to post the wrong answer.” Be-
ing publicly wrong attracts teachers, as long as you don’t do it in such
high quantity that people give up on you altogether. Conversely, once
you’ve gotten something wrong in public, you never forget it.
