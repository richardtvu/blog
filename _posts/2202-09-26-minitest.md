title: _Wish_ to learn how to write tests for the 21 project

- **WISH**: I _wish_ to learn how to write unit tests for the 21 project, starting with _just_ one unit test for the 21 project. For example, test that a new deck will contain 52 cards.
- **OUTCOME**: The ideal _outcome_ is being able to help my friends who are still in RB101 to continue moving forward with their learning and help them get real-time feedback. Consequently, I help meet my need for contribution, love, and support.
- **OBSTACLE**: The main inner _obstacle_ is my fear and worry about procrastinating on my RB120 progress.
- **PLAN**: If I end up feeling fear or might end up procrastinating on moving forward, then I'll set a time-limit for creating one unit test to 3 days (i.e. have at least one unit test by end September 29) and if I have nothing, then I'll let go of the project and move forward with getting an overview of RB120.
