- Cast a wide-net when researching to avoid premature commitment to poor but tempting solutions.
- Start by researching the things interesting to you and then presenting topics to your team members. Keep the topics that interest everyone and discard the rest.
- Have detailed team discussions everyday (or as often as needed) to identify pitfalls and trade-offs of solutions. This in-depth and deep thinking will help you determine where to go next.
- Set up automated processes to ensure consistency, e.g. naming contracts for configurations, git workflow, design meeting flow.
- Seek out team members with different interests and strengths to make assignment of work simpler.
- When the team has technical disagreements, discuss the trade-offs, the sacrifices, the pros, etc as a team and decide on where to go next as a team.
- When thinking about whether to wrap an open-source solution or build your solution from the ground-up, weigh the supposed time saved wrapping an open-source solution against the potential pitfalls (e.g. having to design your architecture around the open-source solution and making it fragile).
- If possible, use relevant animations that are synced to your verbal communication to promote ease of understanding in audience members.
