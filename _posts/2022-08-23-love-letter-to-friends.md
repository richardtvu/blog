Dear Love,

You mean a lot to me. My dear JD, Pocahontas, fellow Launch School students, and seekers of meaning and love. Through our friendships, discussions, mutual support, and simply by your presence, you've helped me cultivate meaning, love, and purpose in my life.

I'm in the middle of preparing for the written assessment (WA) for RB109 and there have been many times I've doubted whether I was ready, whether I could pass, and I still have doubts. I've had many a moment of procrastination as I felt unsure of what to study or where to go next. But my interactions with you (Pocahontas and JD) and other students have helped me keep going, if only so that I may support your journey to programming.

Today, I woke up extra early for whatever reason, so I got to prepare for my morning run in a more intentional and leisurely way... which seems to have opened my mind to an insight and calling to my soul. It's an insight that seems to give me clarity and hope and fills me with gratitude and love.

During my run, my heart ached with tenderness and compassion. My soul spoke to me and told me my wish: I wish to help you prepare for the written assessment, to do well in your studies, and beyond.

To help you is my meaning. To grow alongside you and give you the support and kindness I wish I had had growing up is my clarity. Through us, through our relationship, love blossoms: Love of learning, love of friends, love of life.

The main obstacle is my own insufficiency. How can I help you most effectively when I dare not say I'm no master of the material, no guru, no wizard of the magical arts of coding? I currently lack the sufficient insight into where you need most help, how I can best encourage and support you. And most of all, I fear I lack the sufficient competency to teach you. However, I have a plan.

My plan is to do my best to learn the material and go through the preparation process beyond what I'd normally do for myself (which in our relationship is what ends up happening anyways).I wish to do my best to go through the WA prep questions, answer the questions, revise my answers, and be able to share what I've learned with you and help you to practice being concise and sufficiently detailed in your WA answers. Through this practice, practice, practice, I'll gain the confidence and faith needed to help you.

However, I know my inner obstacle here is perfectionism and fear that I'll disappoint you. The perfect is the enemy of the good (enough), so ...  I'll study alongside you and continue having our deep discussions while doing my best to prepare. After all, it's not only about supporting you, I gain so much from our relating and studying together: Kindness for myself and others, patience, love, and motivation to keep going.

So. Let's begin with this first step. I publish this letter and you see my wishes for us. May I keep taking small steps to helping and being helped by you, my dear friend.

Sincerely,

"J. Smith" the Vu
