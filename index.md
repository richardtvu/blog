## Purpose

Help Richard learn by providing a place for him to write about things he's learned and share those pieces in public. For instance, one idea Richard has been thinking about is the relationship between principles for software development and principles for living life well.

**Disclaimer**: This blog will contain thoughts I’m having as I’m learning, especially as I go beyond my comfort zone. My posts will most likely have many grammar, spelling, and logic errors. I'll try not to be _too_ wrong, but can't guarantee the accuracy of what I'm writing, so make sure to fact check me and check with the appropriate doctor, lawyer, w.e legal professional before trying out these ideas.
